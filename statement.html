    <h2>Visual & Interaction Design Choices</h2>

    <p>
      The design of my Hong Kong destination website was inspired by the city’s unique blend of modern vibrancy and cultural tradition. I wanted the overall look to feel warm, inviting, and reflective of Hong Kong’s bustling atmosphere. The color palette combines deep reds and gold tones (#611107 and #ffcc00), which are traditionally associated with prosperity and celebration in Chinese culture. These rich hues are balanced with lighter background colors such as #EDDADA and #FFECE8 to maintain readability and visual comfort throughout the site.
    </p>

    <p>
      For typography, I chose two contrasting yet complementary Google Web Fonts: <strong>Charis SIL</strong> and <strong>Assistant</strong>. Charis SIL, used for headings, has a classic, elegant serif style that adds sophistication and stability, while Assistant is a clean and modern sans-serif typeface used for paragraphs, ensuring clarity and legibility. This combination reflects Hong Kong’s harmony between old and new—where history meets innovation. Text placement and size were carefully chosen for accessibility and flow, with centered introductions and justified paragraphs to guide the viewer’s reading naturally down the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      The imagery on each page was selected to highlight the diversity of Hong Kong’s experiences—from its stunning skyline to its lively food scene. Each image section is framed with soft shadows and rounded corners for a polished, modern look. Interactive elements, such as buttons, were designed in bright gold with rounded edges and a hover effect to attract attention without overwhelming the viewer. Buttons are placed beneath key text sections and hero banners to serve as clear calls-to-action, encouraging engagement like booking or requesting information. Altogether, the combination of thoughtful colors, balanced typography, and intuitive layout creates a cohesive user experience that reflects the energy and elegance of Hong Kong.
